# Getting started

## Installation

* Download v1.1.2 of the datapack
    [here](https://yadi.sk/d/j1qI69z-X-L44w).
* Within your Minecraft world file, place the zip file into the `datapacks` subfolder.
* Open the world, or if it’s already running, use the `/reload` command.
  * BlingEdit does not work in peaceful mode.

## The BlingEdit sword

To use any of the datapack’s features, you must create the BlingEdit Sword. Simply put a diamond sword into an anvil,
and rename it to BlingEdit. Note that correct spacing and capitalization is required. Everything in the datapack
requires you to be holding the BlingEdit Sword.
