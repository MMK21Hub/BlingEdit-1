# Getting started

## Installation

* Download v1.0.2 of the datapack
    [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZQ--80WKODF_wW_H8tRrX8LBbSPke6SE/view?usp=sharing).
* Within your Minecraft world file, place `blingedit.zip` into the `datapacks` subfolder.
* Launch the world, or if it’s already running, use the `/reload` command.
  * The world must not be in peaceful mode.

## The BlingEdit sword

To use any of the datapack’s features, you must create the BlingEdit Sword. Simply put a diamond sword into an anvil,
and rename it to BlingEdit. Note that correct spacing and capitalization is required. Everything in the datapack
requires you to be holding the BlingEdit Sword.
