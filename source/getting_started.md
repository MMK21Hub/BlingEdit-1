# Getting started

## Installation

* Download v1.1.2 of the datapack
    [here](https://yadi.sk/d/j1qI69z-X-L44w).
* Within your Minecraft world file, place the zip file into the `datapacks` subfolder.
* Open the world, or if itâ€™s already running, use the `/reload` command.
  * BlingEdit does not work in peaceful mode.

## The BlingEdit Wand

To start using BlingEdit, you must obtain a BlingEdit Wand. This is eather a carrot on a stick or a diamond sword, 
and both can be obtained by clicking the buttons that appear in chat after `/reload`-ing.
An alternate method is, using an anvil, to rename a diamond sword or carrot on a stick to `BlingEdit`, 
which will turn it into a Wand.
Note that correct spacing and capitalization is required. 
Everything in the datapack requires you to be holding the BlingEdit Wand.
